- [Beta Embeddings for Multi-Hop Logical Reasoning in Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.11465v1.pdf) proposes a novel entity embedding and reasoning approach to reason over entities in a knowledge graph (KG). By using beta-distribution embeddings, it becomes possible to formulate complete FOL expressions with $\wedge,\vee$ and $\neg$ operators to query the knowledge graph, enabling answering questions like "Which European countries have never hosted a World Cup?".
